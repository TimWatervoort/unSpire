unSpire is a site that provides you with inspiration, whatever your needs.
To reach your inspirational potential, when you navigate to the main page, input your name.

You will be taken to a welcome page where you can choose one of three options.

<< I need motivation for my business. >>
Here, you will be provided with a random inspirational picture, along with a very meaningful quote.
To be more precise, this quote is a sentence made from random corporate buzzwords that have been translated through five languages and then back to English, so you get gems like:
'Cooperation To Reduce The High Level Of Human Resources'
and
'The Fitness Of The Scene To Replace'.

<< I need inspiration for a name. >>
Here, you will be given a random face along with a brilliant name.
Actually, this name is also randomly generated, and you are shown their nickname, which is randomly generated from the same array as the business quotes. Some examples of beautiful names include:
Lloyd "Cross Functional Testing Procedures" Simmons
and
Cristóvão "Worldwide Storage" Pereira.

<< I need a life changing quote. >>
Here, you will be given a random inspirational quote along with its author and when they bestowed this brilliant wisdom upon the world.
The author, however, is randomly generated from a list of people and the year is randomly attributed. Thus, you are provided with things like:
You get up early in the morning and you work all day. That’s the only secret.
-George Clooney, 1165 BC
and
As a profession, graphic designers have been shamefully remiss or ineffective about plying their craft for social or political betterment.
-Kanye West, 916 AD

Below all of these, you will see a save button, which will let you access these later.

On the navbar, you will see four buttons. The first, the logo, will take you to the homepage.
The features dropdown has two options:

<< Favorites >>
The favorites page lets you access any inspirational gems that you have saved, cycle through them, and remove them when you're tired of them.

<< Nickname Generator >>
The nickname generator is very similar to the naming inspiration option, but allows your own input of name and an optional photo.

The themes dropdown has five options:

<< Light Mode >>
A pleasant blue theme.

<< Dark Mode >>
The default theme, made of different greys.

<< Darker Mode >>
Difficult to read, made mostly of black with some greys.

<< Adventure Mode >>
Not for the faint of heart, this mode will flash red and blue until you choose a different theme.

<< Awful Mode >>
Avoid.

Please enjoy unSpire!
