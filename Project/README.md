To reach your inspirational potential, when you navigate to the main page, input your name.
![Homepage](/images/homepage.png)

You will be taken to a welcome page where you can choose one of three options.
![Choices](/images/choices.png?raw=true "Choices")

<< I need motivation for my business. >>

Here, you will be provided with a random inspirational picture, along with a very meaningful quote.
To be more precise, this quote is a sentence made from random corporate buzzwords that have been translated through five languages and then back to English, so you get gems like:
'Cooperation To Reduce The High Level Of Human Resources'
and
'The Fitness Of The Scene To Replace'.

<< I need inspiration for a name. >>

Here, you will be given a random face along with a brilliant name.
Actually, this name is also randomly generated, and you are shown their nickname, which is randomly generated from the same array as the business quotes. Some examples of beautiful names include:
Lloyd "Cross Functional Testing Procedures" Simmons
and
Cristóvão "Worldwide Storage" Pereira.
![Naming](/images/naming.png?raw=true "Naming")

<< I need a life changing quote. >>

Here, you will be given a random inspirational quote along with its author and when they bestowed this brilliant wisdom upon the world.
The author, however, is randomly generated from a list of people and the year is randomly attributed. Thus, you are provided with things like:
You get up early in the morning and you work all day. That’s the only secret.
-George Clooney, 1165 BC
and
As a profession, graphic designers have been shamefully remiss or ineffective about plying their craft for social or political betterment.
-Kanye West, 916 AD
